#Steps
For creating the Employee Management System in Python that uses MySQL database we need to connect Python with MySQL.
For making a connection we need to install mysqlconnector which can be done by writing the following command in the command prompt on Windows or MacOs. "pip install mysql-connector-python".
NB: - to install specific version: "pip install mysql-connector-python==version_number"
    - to uninstall the current MySQL connector version: "pip uninstall mysql-connector-python"
